Low-Memory Dropout
==================

In this tutorial, you will write a memory-efficient implementation of dropout whose state
will be composed of a single int32 seed. This differs from more traditional implementations of dropout,
whose state is generally composed of a bit mask tensor of the same shape as the input.

In doing so, you will learn about:

* The limitations of naive implementations of Dropout with PyTorch.

* Parallel pseudo-random number generation in Triton.

Baseline
--------

The *dropout* operator was first introduced in [SRIVASTAVA2014]_ as a way to improve the performance
of deep neural networks in low-data regime (i.e. regularization).

It takes a vector as input and produces a vector of the same shape as output. Each scalar in the
output has a probability :math:`p` of being changed to zero and otherwise it is copied from the input.
This forces the network to perform well even when only :math:`1 - p` scalars from the input are available.

At evaluation time we want to use the full power of the network so we set :math:`p=0`. Naively this would
increase the norm of the output (which can be a bad thing, e.g. it can lead to artificial decrease
in the output softmax temperature). To prevent this we multiply the output by :math:`\frac{1}{1 - p}`, which
keeps the norm consistent regardless of the dropout probability.

Let's first take a look at the baseline implementation.

Seeded dropout
--------------

The above implementation of dropout works fine, but it can be a bit awkward to deal with. Firstly
we need to store the dropout mask for backpropagation. Secondly, dropout state management can get
very tricky when using recompute/checkpointing (e.g. see all the notes about `preserve_rng_state` in
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html). In this tutorial we'll describe an alternative implementation
that (1) has a smaller memory footprint; (2) requires less data movement; and (3) simplifies the management
of persisting randomness across multiple invocations of the kernel.

Pseudo-random number generation in Triton is simple! In this tutorial we will use the
:code:`triton.language.rand` function which generates a block of uniformly distributed :code:`float32`
values in [0, 1), given a seed and a block of :code:`int32` offsets. But if you need it, Triton also provides
other :ref:`random number generation strategies<Random Number Generation>`.

.. note::
   Triton's implementation of PRNG is based on the Philox algorithm (described on [SALMON2011]_).

Let's put it all together.

Et Voilà! We have a triton kernel that applies the same dropout mask provided the seed is the same!
If you'd like explore further applications of pseudorandomness in GPU programming, we encourage you
to explore the `python/triton/language/random.py`!

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-167

Exercises
---------

1. Extend the kernel to operate over a matrix and use a vector of seeds - one per row.
2. Add support for striding.
3. (challenge) Implement a kernel for sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform which generates the projection matrix on the fly each time using a seed.
