Fused Softmax
=============

In this tutorial, you will write a fused softmax operation that is significantly faster
than PyTorch's native op for a particular class of matrices: those whose rows can fit in
the GPU's SRAM.

In doing so, you will learn about:

* The benefits of kernel fusion for bandwidth-bound operations.

* Reduction operators in Triton.

Motivations
-----------

Custom GPU kernels for elementwise additions are educationally valuable but won't get you very far in practice.
Let us consider instead the case of a simple (numerically stabilized) softmax operation:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-51

.. code-block:: Python


    import torch

    import triton
    import triton.language as tl


    @torch.jit.script
    def naive_softmax(x):
        """Compute row-wise softmax of X using native pytorch

        We subtract the maximum element in order to avoid overflows. Softmax is invariant to
        this shift.
        """
        # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
        x_max = x.max(dim=1)[0]
        # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
        z = x - x_max[:, None]
        # read  MN elements ; write MN elements
        numerator = torch.exp(z)
        # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
        denominator = numerator.sum(dim=1)
        # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
        ret = numerator / denominator[:, None]
        # in total: read 5MN + 2M elements ; wrote 3MN + 2M elements
        return ret









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-60

When implemented naively in PyTorch, computing :code:`y = naive_softmax(x)` for :math:`x \in R^{M \times N}`
requires reading :math:`5MN + 2M` elements from DRAM and writing back :math:`3MN + 2M` elements.
This is obviously wasteful; we'd prefer to have a custom "fused" kernel that only reads
X once and does all the necessary computations on-chip.
Doing so would require reading and writing back only :math:`MN` bytes, so we could
expect a theoretical speed-up of ~4x (i.e., :math:`(8MN + 4M) / 2MN`).
The `torch.jit.script` flags aims to perform this kind of "kernel fusion" automatically
but, as we will see later, it is still far from ideal.

Compute Kernel
--------------

Our softmax kernel works as follows: each program loads a row of the input matrix X,
normalizes it and writes back the result to the output Y.

Note that one important limitation of Triton is that each block must have a
power-of-two number of elements, so we need to internally "pad" each row and guard the
memory operations properly if we want to handle any possible input shapes:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-97

.. code-block:: Python



    @triton.jit
    def softmax_kernel(output_ptr, input_ptr, input_row_stride, output_row_stride, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):
        # The rows of the softmax are independent, so we parallelize across those
        row_idx = tl.program_id(0)
        # The stride represents how much we need to increase the pointer to advance 1 row
        row_start_ptr = input_ptr + row_idx * input_row_stride
        # The block size is the next power of two greater than n_cols, so we can fit each
        # row in a single block
        col_offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
        input_ptrs = row_start_ptr + col_offsets
        # Load the row into SRAM, using a mask since BLOCK_SIZE may be > than n_cols
        row = tl.load(input_ptrs, mask=col_offsets < n_cols, other=-float('inf'))
        # Subtract maximum for numerical stability
        row_minus_max = row - tl.max(row, axis=0)
        # Note that exponentiation in Triton is fast but approximate (i.e., think __expf in CUDA)
        numerator = tl.exp(row_minus_max)
        denominator = tl.sum(numerator, axis=0)
        softmax_output = numerator / denominator
        # Write back output to DRAM
        output_row_start_ptr = output_ptr + row_idx * output_row_stride
        output_ptrs = output_row_start_ptr + col_offsets
        tl.store(output_ptrs, softmax_output, mask=col_offsets < n_cols)

We can create a helper function that enqueues the kernel and its (meta-)arguments for any given input tensor.

        n_rows, n_cols = x.shape
        # The block size is the smallest power of two greater than the number of columns in `x`
        BLOCK_SIZE = triton.next_power_of_2(n_cols)
        # Another trick we can use is to ask the compiler to use more threads per row by
        # increasing the number of warps (`num_warps`) over which each row is distributed.
        # You will see in the next tutorial how to auto-tune this value in a more natural
        # way so you don't have to come up with manual heuristics yourself.
        num_warps = 4
        if BLOCK_SIZE >= 2048:
            num_warps = 8
        if BLOCK_SIZE >= 4096:
            num_warps = 16
        # Allocate output
        y = torch.empty_like(x)
        # Enqueue kernel. The 1D launch grid is simple: we have one kernel instance per row o
        # f the input matrix
        softmax_kernel[(n_rows, )](
            y,
            x,

Unit Test
---------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-137

We make sure that we test our kernel on a matrix with an irregular number of rows and columns.
This will allow us to verify that our padding mechanism works.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-144

.. code-block:: Python


    torch.manual_seed(0)
    x = torch.randn(1823, 781, device='cuda')
    y_triton = softmax(x)
    y_torch = torch.softmax(x, axis=1)
    assert torch.allclose(y_triton, y_torch), (y_triton, y_torch)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 145-146

As expected, the results are identical.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 148-153

Benchmark
---------

Here we will benchmark our operation as a function of the number of columns in the input matrix -- assuming 4096 rows.
We will then compare its performance against (1) :code:`torch.softmax` and (2) the :code:`naive_softmax` defined above.

In the above plot, we can see that:
 - Triton is 4x faster than the Torch JIT. This confirms our suspicions that the Torch JIT does not do any fusion here.
 - Triton is noticeably faster than :code:`torch.softmax` -- in addition to being **easier to read, understand and maintain**.
   Note however that the PyTorch `softmax` operation is more general and will work on tensors of any shape.
