    The `proton_gpu.segment` type represents a segment returned by `PTG_SegmentOp`.

    Each segment is private to a profiling unit as defined by the `granularity` attribute.
    The selected segments, specified by the `selectIds` attribute, collectively total `nBytes` bytes.

    When lowered to LLVM, a segment becomes a struct containing:
    - `base`: pointer to the start of the internal buffer
    - `segmentBase`: pointer to each segment's start in the internal buffer
    - `indexPtr`: pointer to the current index within the segment

    The segment can reside in global memory, shared memory, or stack memory depending on the `memorySpace` attribute.
