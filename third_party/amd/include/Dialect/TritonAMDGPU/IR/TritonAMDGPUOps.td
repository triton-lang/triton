    A placeholder op for instruction scheduling hints applied to instructions within
    a basic block where the placeholder op is located. This op is primarily intended
    to be used to adjust instruction scheduling inside the resulting main loop
    of a `tt.dot` operation. It's easier to identify dot ops at a high level and, thus,
    to mark intended scheduling regions. The hint ops are eventually lowered
    into LLVM AMDGPU instruction scheduling primitives, which are meant to control
    how different kinds of instructions (valu/mfma, global/shared memory, etc.) should
    interleave for better instruction level parallelism.
