"""The :mod:`algorithms` module is intended to contain some specific algorithms
in order to execute very common evolutionary algorithms. The method used here
are more for convenience than reference as the implementation of every 
evolutionary algorithm may vary infinitely. Most of the algorithms in this 
module use operators registered in the toolbox. Generaly, the keyword used are
:meth:`mate` for crossover, :meth:`mutate` for mutation, :meth:`~deap.select`
for selection and :meth:`evaluate` for evaluation.

You are encouraged to write your own algorithms in order to make them do what

    The variation goes as follow. First, the parental population
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}` is duplicated using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method
    and the result is put into the offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.
    A first loop over :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mate pairs of consecutive
    individuals. According to the crossover probability *cxpb*, the
    individuals :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{x}_{i+1}` are mated
    using the :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. The resulting children
    :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{y}_{i+1}` replace their respective
    parents in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. A second loop over the resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mutate every individual with a
    probability *mutpb*. When an individual is mutated it replaces its not
    mutated version in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. The resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is returned.
    
    This variation is named *And* beceause of its propention to apply both
    crossover and mutation on the individuals. Note that both operators are
    not applied systematicaly, the resulting individuals can be generated from
    crossover only, mutation only, crossover and mutation, and reproduction
    according to the given probabilities. Both probabilities should be in

    The algorithm takes in a population and evolves it in place using the
    :meth:`varAnd` method. It returns the optimized population and a
    :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the evolution (if
    any). The logbook will contain the generation number, the number of
    evalutions for each generation and the statistics if a
    :class:`~deap.tools.Statistics` if any. The *cxpb* and *mutpb* arguments
    are passed to the :func:`varAnd` function. The pseudocode goes as follow
    ::

        for g in range(ngen):
            population = select(population, len(population))
            offspring = varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb, mutpb)

            population = offspring

    As stated in the pseudocode above, the algorithm goes as follow. First, it
    evaluates the individuals with an invalid fitness. Second, it enters the
    generational loop where the selection procedure is applied to entirely
    replace the parental population. The 1:1 replacement ratio of this
    algorithm **requires** the selection procedure to be stochastic and to
    select multiple times the same individual, for example,
    :func:`~deap.tools.selTournament` and :func:`~deap.tools.selRoulette`.
    Third, it applies the :func:`varAnd` function to produce the next
    generation population. Fourth, it evaluates the new individuals and
    compute the statistics on this population. Finally, when *ngen*
    generations are done, the algorithm returns a tuple with the final
    population and a :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` of the evolution.

    .. note::

        Using a non-stochastic selection method will result in no selection as
        the operator selects *n* individuals from a pool of *n*.

    :meth:`toolbox.select` and :meth:`toolbox.evaluate` aliases to be
    registered in the toolbox.
