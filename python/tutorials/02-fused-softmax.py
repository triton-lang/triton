"""
Fused Softmax
=============

In this tutorial, you will write a fused softmax operation that is significantly faster
than PyTorch's native op for a particular class of matrices: those whose rows can fit in
the GPU's SRAM.

In doing so, you will learn about:

* The benefits of kernel fusion for bandwidth-bound operations.

* Reduction operators in Triton.

# %%
# Motivations
# -----------
#
# Custom GPU kernels for elementwise additions are educationally valuable but won't get you very far in practice.
# Let us consider instead the case of a simple (numerically stabilized) softmax operation:

import torch

import triton
import triton.language as tl
from triton.runtime import driver


def is_hip():
    return triton.runtime.driver.active.get_current_target().backend == "hip"


def is_cdna():
    return is_hip() and triton.runtime.driver.active.get_current_target().arch in ('gfx940', 'gfx941', 'gfx942',
                                                                                   'gfx90a', 'gfx908')


def naive_softmax(x):
    """Compute row-wise softmax of X using native pytorch

    We subtract the maximum element in order to avoid overflows. Softmax is invariant to
    this shift.
    """
    # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
    x_max = x.max(dim=1)[0]
    # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
    z = x - x_max[:, None]
    # read  MN elements ; write MN elements
    numerator = torch.exp(z)
    # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
    denominator = numerator.sum(dim=1)
    # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
    ret = numerator / denominator[:, None]
    # in total: read 5MN + 2M elements ; wrote 3MN + 2M elements
    return ret


# %%
# When implemented naively in PyTorch, computing :code:`y = naive_softmax(x)` for :math:`x \in R^{M \times N}`
# requires reading :math:`5MN + 2M` elements from DRAM and writing back :math:`3MN + 2M` elements.
# This is obviously wasteful; we'd prefer to have a custom "fused" kernel that only reads
# X once and does all the necessary computations on-chip.
# Doing so would require reading and writing back only :math:`MN` bytes, so we could
# expect a theoretical speed-up of ~4x (i.e., :math:`(8MN + 4M) / 2MN`).
# The `torch.jit.script` flags aims to perform this kind of "kernel fusion" automatically
# but, as we will see later, it is still far from ideal.

# %%
# Compute Kernel
# --------------
#
# Our softmax kernel works as follows: each program loads a set of rows of the input matrix X strided by number of programs,
# normalizes it and writes back the result to the output Y.
#
# Note that one important limitation of Triton is that each block must have a
# power-of-two number of elements, so we need to internally "pad" each row and guard the
# memory operations properly if we want to handle any possible input shapes:

    # starting row of the program
    row_start = tl.program_id(0)

    for row_idx in tl.range(row_start, n_rows, row_step, num_stages=num_stages):
        # The stride represents how much we need to increase the pointer to advance 1 row
        row_start_ptr = input_ptr + row_idx * input_row_stride
        # The block size is the next power of two greater than n_cols, so we can fit each
        # row in a single block
        col_offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
        input_ptrs = row_start_ptr + col_offsets
        # Load the row into SRAM, using a mask since BLOCK_SIZE may be > than n_cols
        mask = col_offsets < n_cols
        row = tl.load(input_ptrs, mask=mask, other=-float('inf'))
        # Subtract maximum for numerical stability
        row_minus_max = row - tl.max(row, axis=0)
        # Note that exponentiation in Triton is fast but approximate (i.e., think __expf in CUDA)

# In the above plot, we can see that:
#  - Triton is 4x faster than the Torch JIT. This confirms our suspicions that the Torch JIT does not do any fusion here.
#  - Triton is noticeably faster than :code:`torch.softmax` -- in addition to being **easier to read, understand and maintain**.
#    Note however that the PyTorch `softmax` operation is more general and will work on tensors of any shape.
