Vector Addition
===============

In this tutorial, you will write a simple vector addition using Triton.

In doing so, you will learn about:

* The basic programming model of Triton.

* The `triton.jit` decorator, which is used to define Triton kernels.

* The best practices for validating and benchmarking your custom ops against native reference implementations.

# Compute Kernel
# -----------
import triton
import triton.language as tl

import paddle


@triton.jit
def add_kernel(x_ptr,  # *Pointer* to first input vector.
               y_ptr,  # *Pointer* to second input vector.
               output_ptr,  # *Pointer* to output vector.
               n_elements,  # Size of the vector.
               BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,  # Number of elements each program should process.
               # NOTE: `constexpr` so it can be used as a shape value.
               ):
    # There are multiple 'programs' processing different data. We identify which program
    # we are here:
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)  # We use a 1D launch grid so axis is 0.
    # This program will process inputs that are offset from the initial data.
    # For instance, if you had a vector of length 256 and block_size of 64, the programs
    # would each access the elements [0:64, 64:128, 128:192, 192:256].
    # Note that offsets is a list of pointers:
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    # Create a mask to guard memory operations against out-of-bounds accesses.
    mask = offsets < n_elements
    # Load x and y from DRAM, masking out any extra elements in case the input is not a
    # multiple of the block size.
    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    output = x + y
    # Write x + y back to DRAM.
    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)


# %%
# Let's also declare a helper function to (1) allocate the `z` tensor
# and (2) enqueue the above kernel with appropriate grid/block sizes:


def add_paddle(x: paddle.Tensor, y: paddle.Tensor):
    # We need to preallocate the output.
    # output = torch.empty_like(x)
    output = paddle.empty_like(x)

    # 在paddle官网当中找不到类似的接口
    # assert x.is_cuda and y.is_cuda and output.is_cuda

    
    n_elements = len(output)
    # The SPMD launch grid denotes the number of kernel instances that run in parallel.
    # It is analogous to CUDA launch grids. It can be either Tuple[int], or Callable(metaparameters) -> Tuple[int].
    # In this case, we use a 1D grid where the size is the number of blocks:
    grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']), )
    # NOTE:
    #  - Each torch.tensor object is implicitly converted into a pointer to its first element.
    #  - `triton.jit`'ed functions can be indexed with a launch grid to obtain a callable GPU kernel.
    #  - Don't forget to pass meta-parameters as keywords arguments.
    add_kernel[grid](x, y, output, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)
    # We return a handle to z but, since `torch.cuda.synchronize()` hasn't been called, the kernel is still
    # running asynchronously at this point.
    return output


# %%
# We can now use the above function to compute the element-wise sum of two `torch.tensor` objects and test its correctness:

# torch.manual_seed(0)
# size = 98432
# x = torch.rand(size, device='cuda')
# y = torch.rand(size, device='cuda')
# output_torch = x + y
# output_triton = add(x, y)
# print(output_torch)
# print(output_triton)
# print(f'The maximum difference between torch and triton is '
#       f'{torch.max(torch.abs(output_torch - output_triton))}')

size = 98432
paddle.set_device('gpu:0')
shape_tensor = paddle.to_tensor([size])
x = paddle.randn(shape_tensor)
y = paddle.randn(shape_tensor)
output_paddle = x + y
output_triton = add_paddle(x, y)
print(output_paddle)
print(output_triton)
print(f'The maximum difference between paddle and triton is '
      f'{paddle.max(paddle.abs(output_paddle - output_triton))}')

# %%
# Seems like we're good to go!

# %%
# Benchmark
# ---------
#
# We can now benchmark our custom op on vectors of increasing sizes to get a sense of how it does relative to PyTorch.
# To make things easier, Triton has a set of built-in utilities that allow us to concisely plot the performance of our custom ops.
# for different problem sizes.
