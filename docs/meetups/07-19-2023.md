#### Agenda:
1. Alternative backend development approach (e.g. AMD, Intel)
2. State of the documentation, is there a planned effort? If yes, what do you think is the priority?
3. Mechanisms for smaller technical discussions: Slack channel per topic? Dedicated meetings for some topics?
4. Stability, testing, regressions: Improving CI and conformance/testing for validating new back-ends.
5. Language improvements/pain points
6. Discussion of known/anticipated design changes for H100
7. Some specific more tactical areas:
   - int8.
   - A low hanging fruit is to let tl.dot take int8 and leverage mma.
   - Sm75.
   - device functions. How hard is this to support while Triton frontend traverses AST?
   - remove torch dependencies from the frontend. (it sounds like there is already progress on this but could be worth discussing)
